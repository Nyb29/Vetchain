This project will provide the solution to how to deal with animal properties in the following areas;
-	Proving transparency and information about the animal’s ownership.
-	Making sure the animal is healthy and doesn’t lack compulsory treatment.
-	Broadcasting the Lost status, so that in the event of the dog being found by any of the relevant entities, it can be securely brought back to the owner.
